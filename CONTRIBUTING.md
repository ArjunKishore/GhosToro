## How to

This project use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to manage different tasks. The core project is inside the **dev** folder, so you have to modify all your css, javascript and handlebars in there. Running `grunt` it will copy and optimize all the files from **dev** to the main folder.
You can/should delete the **dev** folder once published.
