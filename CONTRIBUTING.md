## How to

This project use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to manage different tasks. The development asset is inside the **dev** folder, so you have to modify all your css and javascript in there. Running `grunt` it will optimize all the files from **dev** to the main assets folder.
Feel free to manage the Handlebars files in the main directory.
You _can / should_ delete the **dev** folder once published.
